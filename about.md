# Logistics

## Device Setup
We strongly recommend bringing your own Windows or MacOS laptops so you can keep all files to yourself. Otherwise, you may use the York iMacs which we will set up for the program.

## Safety
You are expected to attend ALL activities, lessons, and project work sessions. You may not leave the class or campus unless parents have notified us and arranged for you to be picked up at a different time. Please let us know of any allergies or medical needs before hand as well as filling out your emergency contact information here: https://forms.gle/PpQzhaaTRkjn5GvB8

## Lunches
Please pack your own lunches :) we will try our best to provide some snacks. There will not be lunch trucks on campus. However, you can also order delivery during lunch break, just like during a normal school day at York with letting the drivers drop off the food at the drop off circle.
